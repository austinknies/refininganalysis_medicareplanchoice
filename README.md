# refininganalysis_medicareplanchoice
This repository contains the R code used for the data cleaning, empirical analysis, and resulting figures and tables included in DeDad, Knies, Lugovskyy, and Skiba (2024), "Refining the Analysis of Medicare Plan Choices and Utilization: A Disagreggated Approach," a working paper ([Link to latest draft](https://github.com/austinknies/refininganalysis_medicareplanchoice/blob/main/RefiningAnalysis_WP.pdf)).

To run this code, we use Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) 2015-2019 Survey and Cost Supplement Files. For more information about the data and how to obtain it, please visit the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services MCBS website.](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/research/medicare-current-beneficiary-survey)
